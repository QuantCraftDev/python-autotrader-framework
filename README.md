# Python Autotrader Framework

A broker-agnostic, Python-native framework for building autonomous
low-frequency trading systems.

This repository demonstrates architecture and execution scaffolding.
No proprietary strategies or broker credentials are included.
## Status

This is a sanitized public version.
Live trading logic and broker integrations are intentionally excluded.

For custom implementations or consulting, see GitHub profile.
## Services

I design and build custom, production-grade algorithmic trading systems in Python,
including broker integrations, autonomous execution, logging, and risk controls.

This public repository demonstrates framework architecture only.
Custom strategies, broker connections, and deployments are built privately.
